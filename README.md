# My Laravel Frontend Preset

A Laravel frontend preset that scaffolds out new applications just the way I like 'em'! üëåüèª 

### Before you start, a word of advice
This package should only be used with a **NEW** Laravel project as it will overwrite multiple files. After you run the preset command, it is **highly recommended** that the package be removed by running `composer remove randyrankin/laravel-preset`. 

### What are we doing?
- Remove Bootstrap, JQuery, Lodash and Popper.js
- Install [Tailwind CSS 1.0](https://tailwindcss.com) 
- Install [Laravel Mix Purgecss](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-mix-purgecss)
- Customize webpack.mix.js
- Enhance .gitignore
- Replacing all views with Tailwind friendly versions

Note: purgeCss() and version() does not run in dev builds (see webpack.mix.js). 

### Installation:
`composer require randyrankin/laravel-preset`

### Usage:
`php artisan preset laravel-preset`
